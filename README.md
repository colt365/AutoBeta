Need your help to write more functional test cases, first:
====

	1. npm install (set up packages)
	2. cd tests/wdio/phantomjs-standalone
	3. bash enableTest.sh
	4. npm run test-wdioSP (run test cases)
	5. To add more test for wdio, under /tests/wdio/specs/ , you may look on testTemplate.js

Note
====
For Windows, in setp 3, sorry exclusive for unix like system, so then just do it mannually or kindly update a new .bat
	

Thank you very much!!
