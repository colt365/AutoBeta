Demo of this branch
====
	2you see there two patterns:
		for lib/ there are *spec.js, this style is to test model unit test, try run "npm run test-unit", which is direction to test-unit cmd in package.json

		for tests/ , let it be integration test sytle, test external library functionality, try run "npm test", which directin the Makefile test file

Testing
	1. integrate with mocha, chai, (installed babel-cli  chai  express  mocha  phantomjs  request  webdriverjs should)
		mocha usage
			1. "make test" usage : use Makefile to config mocha and run tests
			2. npm run mocha tests
			3. default mocha look for test/ folder for test cases, not tests/
	(read) Test spies, stubs and mocks: sinon (for test setup).
	"make test" same as "npm test", set by pakcage.json
	"npm run test-unit" is using *.spec.js standard
